This project implements a ROS2-based control system for a robotic car where movement is controlled from a joystick. A ROS2 node running on the computer reads joystick input and converts it into movement commands such as forward, backward, speed, and steering angle. These commands are published as ROS2 messages and received by a second ROS2 node responsible for communication with the robot’s firmware. The firmware runs on a microcontroller (for example ESP32 or STM32), which interprets the received commands and generates control signals for the motors. The propulsion of the robot is achieved with a BLDC motor connected through an ESC, while steering is performed using a servo motor controlled by PWM. In practice, the pipeline works as follows: the user moves the joystick, the first ROS2 node reads the input and publishes the command to a topic, the motor-control ROS2 node subscribes to that topic and forwards the processed command to the microcontroller through serial or CAN communication, and the firmware outputs the appropriate PWM and throttle signals to the ESC and the servo motor. With this architecture, the robot car becomes responsive to joystick input, allowing smooth acceleration, braking, and steering. The project cleanly separates high-level control (ROS2) from low-level execution (firmware driving the motors), making the system modular, debuggable, and easy to extend.
